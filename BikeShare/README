I downloaded the Bike Share data from each of these cities that was made public on their websites, and I proceeded to clean the data
accordingly and answered a list of questions I created for each city. Once the analysis for each city was complete, I compared each 
cities system to the others to determine how well utilized and maintained they were.

You'll find the individual analyses for each of the cities here as well as the comparison.

In the graphs folder you'll find the graphs I created for each city based on the questions I wanted to answer along with the comparison graphs.
