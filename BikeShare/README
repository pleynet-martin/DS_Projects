I downloaded the Bike Share data from each of these cities that was made public on their websites, and I proceeded to clean the data
accordingly and answered a list of questions I created for each city. Once the analysis for each city was complete, I compared each 
city's system to the others to determine how well utilized and maintained in comparison to other around the country. I tracked how 
each bike share system changed over a three year period from 2017-2019.

You'll find the individual analyses for each of the cities as well as the comparison in this folder.

You'll find the graphs I created for each city based on the questions I wanted to answer along with the comparison graphs in the graphs folder.
