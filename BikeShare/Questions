1. Demographics of riders (age, gender)
3. Average time per ride (overall, age groups, subscriber v casual, etc.)

6. Time of day when people ride the least(during week, on weekend)
7. How many stations are there each year? (Track increase in number of stations)

14. Compare number of bikes per 1000 people
15. Compare number of stations per square mile
16. Compare trips per bike share bicycle per day
17. Compare trip duration
18. Compare subscribership percentage

All conclusions and analysis is drawn from 2017-2019 data for each city
