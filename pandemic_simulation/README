These files will clean the initial raw patient data such that there are uniform columns with each column
containing the same type of data either:
1. Recorder number
2. Patient number (a unique number assigned to each patient)
3. Date of data entry
4. Patient's date of birth
5. Patient's sex/gender
6. Patient's home postal code
7. Patient's state at time of entry (either Infected, Recovered, Dead)
8. Pateint's temperature at time of entry
9. Number of days the patient has been symptomatic

In four stages, we take raw data and convert it into its final fully uniform form. Then using this
uniform data, we can then create a patient object for each patient to store each of their attributes.
Using the patient state data, we graph the the number of patients for each state as well as the
fatality rate for each age group rounded to the nearest 5.
